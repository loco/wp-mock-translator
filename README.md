# Mock Translation API for Loco Translate

This is an example add-on for the [Loco Translate WordPress plugin](https://github.com/loco/wp-loco) that produces well-formed nonsense.

External translation APIs are available in Loco Translate from v2.4.0. In addition to the [built-in providers](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/manual/providers)
you may define your own service by hooking into the plugin as demonstrated in this example.

The auto-translation process is invoked from the PO file editor by clicking either the "Auto" button (for processing the entire file) or by using the "Suggest translation" button from the editing pane.

If you have any questions about this, please ask on the WordPress support forum:
